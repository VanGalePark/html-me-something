  <h1>Oh the Places I'll Go (and have gone!)</h1>
  <p>I have been to 8 states in my 18 years of life, including Missouri and Kansas. <br> The other 6 states are
    Colorado, Oregon, California, Michigan, Illinois, and Florida.</p>
  <p>I have never been outside of the country but I obviously have time to do so!</p>

  <div id="theState">
    <h2>Missouri</h2>
    <p>Missouri is the state I was born in and I currently live in. I went to Woodland Elementary School from kidergarten to 1st grade.
    From 2nd grade to the beginning of 9th grade (freshman year) I attended Fronteir School of Innovation. After about a month or so of
    9th grade I decided to go into homeschooling. During my homeschool years, I ended up graduating early. I mean, only a year early but it makes
    a differene! Because I am not in school I have time to work on this coding class and work on things I enjoy!</p>
