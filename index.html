  <h1>Oh the Places I'll Go (and have gone!)</h1>
  <main>I have been to 8 states in my 18 years of life, including Missouri and Kansas. <br> The other 6 states are Colorado, Oregon, California,
    Michigan, Illinois, and Florida. <br><br> I have never been outside of the country but I obviously have the time to do so!</main>

  <article> Summary of the states ive been to. </article>
  <h2 id="stateName">Kansas City, Missouri</h2>
  <p id="stateParagraph">Although Missouri is the state that I was born in and currently live in, it's definetly the most interesting
  part of my life. Starting from the beginning, I only attended 3 schools. Woodland Elementary School from kindergarten to 1st grade. Frontier School
  of Innovation from 2nd grade to freshman year (9th grade). Although, after a month or so of highschool I decided to go into homeschooling.
  While I was homeschooled, I graduated early. I mean, it was only a year early but it was still early!</p>
